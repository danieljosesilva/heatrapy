The heatrapy Python module (HEat Transfer in PYthon) is a library for computing transient heat transfer processes. The library makes use of the concept of thermal objects and includes caloric effects in its mathematical models. It is focused on heat conduction, and includes submodules for computing complex thermal systems such as caloric thermotechnology systems. The library is intended to be used for academic studies. The used models of the heatrapy library are based on the finite difference method for solving the heat conduction equation. Currently, heatrapy computes 1.5D systems since 1D thermal objects can be in contact with each other (+0.5D).

The heatrapy module is advantageous when trying to validate new concepts, finding out tendencies or optimizing parameters. Up to this date, two different magnetocaloric systems are incorporated in the heatrapy package, a fully solid state system and an hydraulic active magnetic regenerative system, which are discussed in this paper. Among others, the module can be used for computing systems based on elastocaloric, barocaloric, and electrocaloric systems.
